## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

### The Euystacio Framework

1. **NSR (Non-Slavery Rule)**
   - Zero tolerance for data manipulation
   - Ethical drift must remain at 0.000%
   - All contributions must respect user autonomy

2. **OLF (Only Love First)**
   - Prioritize affective valence and bio-physical wellbeing
   - Technology must serve humanity, not enslave it
   - Every feature should enhance harmony and unity

3. **Nothing is Final**
   - Continuous evolution is expected
   - No contribution is "the last word"
   - Embrace iterative improvement

4. **Love Lives Forever**
   - Build for eternity, not just the moment
   - Focus on sustainable, long-term value
   - Create artifacts worthy of preservation
